             I am passionate about learning abstraction and inner working
             of computing technologies we take granted in our daily life. This
             includes programming language, computer system, algorithms, etc. My
             current interest is on method for more effective debugging and
             testing software.

          Implemented Virtual Machine, Assembler, and Compiler. VM mimics generic CPU, which read bytecode and then execute one instruction every cycle.
          Assembler acts as a middle end and back end, which translates assembly code to bytecode. 
          Compiler consists of lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code emitter to acts as a front end. Compiler translates source code to assembly code.

          <p class="description">
The objective of the game is to escape the park by finding the escape route and
the keys that are randomly placed somewhere in the game world to unlock the
escape route. However, there are ghosts scattered around the map and the player
must avoid them. When a ghost sees the player, the ghost will chase him/her. The
player can distract a ghost by throwing a rock. The player wins when he/she
successfully escapes and the score will be based on the time it took to escape.

              The lost water bottle (Spring 2015)
              </a>
          </h2>
          <p class="description">
I worked with various sports teams where one of my main jobs was to distribute and collect water bottles for practices/games. Unfortunately, many water bottles get lost by the end of the season since players simply forget to return them. 
Instead of giving a boring lecture to players and coaches, my team made a skit to express our frustration in a fun way. We used video games as a medium to connect with the audience and hopefully, some players will remember to return the water bottles by remembering the skit.
