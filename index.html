I am passionate about learning abstraction and the science behind the computing technologies we take for granted in our daily life. My favorite topics are the compiler, computer systems, and algorithms. Always been fascinated that how we precisely communicate what we want to a computer through science, not magic!

          Built a C-like (C subset) programming language from scratch.
          Implemented Virtual Machine, Assembler, and Compiler. VM mimics
          generic CPU, which reads bytecode and then executes one instruction
          every cycle. Assembler acts as a back end, which translates assembly
          code to bytecode. The compiler consists of a lexer, parser, semantic
          analyzer, and code emitter to translate the source into assembly code.

The project was divided into two parts. In the first part, a basic transport
protocol that provides reliable datagram service was implemented. Then, for the
second part, a TCP Reno-like congestion control algorithm was implemented so that the network can provide fair
service to each client.

          <p class="description">
          The objective of the game is to escape the park by finding the escape
          route and keys. Keys are randomly placed somewhere in the game world and used for 
          unlocking the escape route. However, there are ghosts scattered around
          the map and the player must avoid them. When a ghost sees the player, the
          ghost will chase him/her. The player can distract a ghost by throwing
          a rock. The player wins when he/she successfully escapes and the score
          will be based on the time it took to escape. The game utilizes a
          ray-casting algorithm to give the player illusion of a 3-D world.

          <p class="description">
          As a student in the Computer Vision course, our goal is to
          gain a concrete idea of she well-known topics in computer vision by
          creating our own SIFT library from scratch. Topics include SIFT
          detector, SIFT descriptor, and nearest-neighbor matching which lay the
          foundation for many correspondence problems in computer vision. The
          focus of the project is not to create a library that can compete with
          a known library such as OpenCV, but to gainr understanding of existing
          libraries and the ability to implement ideas for an existing/future 
          computer language that may not have support for computer vision application.

              The lost water bottle (Pre-2019)
              </a>
          </h2>
          <p class="description">
I worked with various sports teams where one of my main jobs was to distribute and collect water bottles for practices/games. Unfortunately, many water bottles get lost by the end of the season since players simply forget to return them. From that, I got the idea of making a fun skit. We used video games as a medium to connect with the audience and hopefully, some players remembered to return the water bottles by remembering the skit.
