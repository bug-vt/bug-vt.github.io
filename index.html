            Many people utilize food ordering apps for their convenience and
            discounts, but given their possible effect on consumers spending
            habits, are they helping or harming their amount spent annually? In

          <p class="description">
I worked with various sports teams where one of my main jobs was to distribute and collect water bottles for practices/games. Unfortunately, many water bottles get lost by the end of the season since players simply forget to return them. 
Instead of giving a boring lecture to players and coaches, my team made a skit to express our frustration in a fun way. We used video games as a medium to connect with the audience and hopefully, some players will remember to return the water bottles by remembering the skit.

          <p class="description">
            The objective of the game is to escaping the park by finding the
            escape route and the key to unlock the escape route that are
             randomly placed somewhere in the game world. However, there are
             ghosts scatter around the map and player must avoid them. When a
             ghost see the player, ghost will chase him/her. The player can
             distract a ghost throwing a rock. The player win when he/she successfully escape and score will be based on the time it took to escape.
